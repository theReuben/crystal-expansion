# Decision log

Running record of constraint decisions. Anything that drops or changes behaviour
from either parent project gets an entry here, with the count of what was
affected. Nothing gets dropped silently.

## D1 — Textbox: wide (Emerald style)

**Decided by Reuben, 2026-09-13.** Use expansion's window widths throughout.

### The plan's premise for this was inverted

The plan expected "text overflow across thousands of strings" because
CrystalDust uses FRLG's narrower box. Measured, the widths are:

| window | CrystalDust | expansion |
|---|---|---|
| overworld standard (`sStandardTextBox_WindowTemplates`) | 26 tiles / 208 px | **27 tiles / 216 px** |
| battle message (`B_WIN_MSG`) | **28 tiles** | 26 tiles |

CrystalDust's poryscript config confirms the overworld figure: its default font
is `1_latin_rse` at `maxLineLength=208`, i.e. Emerald metrics, not FRLG's 198.

So in the overworld, going wide makes the box **one tile bigger**. Every one of
CrystalDust's 4,820 hard line breaks (`\n`/`\l` across 405 `.pory` files) still
fits, because they were wrapped for a *narrower* box. There is no overflow risk
in that direction at all — only slightly ragged right margins.

The narrowing is in *battle*, 28 → 26 tiles. Per the plan's section 2a we take
expansion's battle files wholesale, so expansion's battle strings arrive already
matched to its own 26-tile box. The exposure is only CrystalDust-authored battle
text that survives in CD-only files — Bug-Catching Contest messages and similar.

**Consequence: Phase 5 shrinks from "audit 33,000 lines" to "audit
CD-authored battle strings."** Still worth scripting a width detector, but it
should be pointed at battle text, not the whole script corpus.

Note CrystalDust uses **zero** `format()` calls — all wrapping is manual. So
nothing re-wraps for free, and cosmetic tidying of the overworld ragged edge is
a real (if optional, and purely visual) cost.

## D2 — Charmap merge: 54 byte-value collisions, must not be unioned blindly

`charmap.txt` maps names to byte sequences. CrystalDust has 1,064 entries,
expansion 1,094.

Good news: **no entry means two different things in the two repos.** Every name
present in both maps to the same bytes (0 conflicts).

Bad news: **54 CrystalDust-only names occupy byte values that expansion-only
names also use.** These are not accidents — they are CrystalDust *renaming
Emerald's slots in place*:

```
AB 01   CD:MUS_AZALEA                expansion:MUS_DEWFORD
95 01   CD:MUS_NEW_BARK              expansion:MUS_LITTLEROOT
7F 01   CD:MUS_ELMS_LAB              expansion:MUS_BIRCH_LAB
...51 more
```

A naive union charmap would leave both names resolving to the same byte. Any
expansion code or script that still plays `MUS_DEWFORD` would silently play
Azalea Town's theme instead. That is precisely the class of silent breakage this
log exists to prevent.

**Decision:** take CrystalDust's charmap as the base for the music ID range,
since CrystalDust's soundtrack replaces Emerald's wholesale (see the size
analysis in `docs/phase0-baselines.md` — that substitution is also what keeps
the ROM under the ceiling). Then sweep expansion's sources for surviving
references to the Hoenn song names and repoint them. Expansion-only song names
with no CrystalDust counterpart keep their IDs.

**Three of the 54 are not music and need real work:**

```
FD 35   CD:B_BUG_CONTEST_MON             expansion:B_ATK_TRAINER_NAME
FD 1A   CD:B_SCR_ACTIVE_ABILITY          expansion:B_SCR_ABILITY
FD 13   CD:B_SCR_ACTIVE_NAME_WITH_PREFIX expansion:B_SCR_NAME_WITH_PREFIX
```

These are battle text-substitution placeholders. Because we take expansion's
`battle_message.c`, `FD 35` will mean "attacking trainer's name". CrystalDust's
Bug-Catching Contest strings that use `B_BUG_CONTEST_MON` would print the wrong
substitution. **These three need fresh IDs allocated and CrystalDust's strings
repointed** — they are a Phase 2 work item, not a copy-and-go.

## D3 — agbcc dropped as a build path

CrystalDust's `progress` HEAD does not compile under agbcc (C99
declaration-after-statement in three field files; agbcc is gcc 2.95). The modern
devkitARM path is the only working route, and is what expansion uses anyway.

**Nothing is lost** — this affects only how the reference ROM is built, not what
is in it. Recorded because the plan anticipated running both toolchains.
